# CropPricingAPI

This is the repo for the Crop Pricing API. 
The API is meant to store data gathered from [National Farmers Information Service of Kenya (NAFIS)](http://www.nafis.go.ke/category/market-info/)
and allow data retrieval from a database for use in our Crop Pricing App.

The API stores the data in a MongoDB database. For security purposes, the credentials are not stored in the repo.

The API uses JSONWebToken to create tokens for user sessions. This is meant to be used in the frontend for validation.
